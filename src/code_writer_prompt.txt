You are a Python programmer. The CSV data files have been exported from GitHub:

<<CSV_SUMMARY>>

Write a complete Python program that:
1. Reads all CSV files in the 'data/' folder (issues_*, commits_*, repo_info_*).
2. Calculates the following metrics per repo:
   - Total issues created
   - Total issues closed
   - Total commits
   - Stars and forks
3. Draws the following charts using matplotlib:
   - Line chart: number of issues created over time
   - Bar chart: stars and forks per repo
   - Pie chart: closed vs open issues across all repos
4. Prints all metrics in a readable format.
Do NOT include explanations or markdown; only provide runnable Python code.
